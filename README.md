This is a Computer vs. Computer "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, which I created after practicing Dave Gray's JS Tutorial for Beginners #1 through #9.
___________________________________
To Run This Game in Windows:
1. Download these files and open them in VSC with the Live Server extension
2. Open a Chrome Browser (about:blank)
3. Use ctrl + shift + J to open the console
4. Click on "Go Live" at the bottom of VSC
5. The first game will automatically display in the console.
6. To "play" again, refresh the browser.

Game Creation Notes:
I used Player and Computer, though both are really the computer.

I borrowed code from My First JS Rock, Paper, Scissors Game.

This version uses Ternary Operator conditionals.
